## Baltimore Sun analysis

By [Christine Zhang](mailto:czhang@baltsun.com)

The Baltimore Sun analyzed crime data from [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij) for a story about the increase in carjackings this year.

The Sun's findings and analysis are available in the "analysis" markdown file in this repository: `analysis.md`.

If you'd like to run the code yourself in R, you can download the R Markdown file `analysis.Rmd` along with the data in the `input` folder.
